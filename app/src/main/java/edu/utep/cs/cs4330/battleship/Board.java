    // Suggestions:
    // 1. Consider using the Observer design pattern so that a client,
    //    say a BoardView, can observe changes on a board, e.g.,
    //    hitting a place, sinking a ship, and game over.
    //
    // 2. Introduce methods including the following:
    //    public boolean placeShip(Ship ship, int x, int y, boolean dir)
    //    public void hit(Place place)
    //    public Place at(int x, int y)
    //    public Place[] places()
    //    public int numOfShots()
    //    public boolean isGameOver()
    //    ...
